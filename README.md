# GM-Aide
A web app designed to randomly generate maps and character/environment descriptions for D&amp;D and other table top RPGs
<br>
This app uses the jQuery library.

##Dungeon Maker
This feature randomly generates dungeon maps in the form of square grids. The desired amount of rooms and deadends is input and a dungeon with those specs (+/- 1) is generated.
<br>
Dungeons are made using by first placing rooms and deadend tiles within the canvas, then rooms are paired up and connected via hallway tiles. Finally, the dungeon continuity is checked and enforced to ensure that every room is connected to the larger dungeon.
